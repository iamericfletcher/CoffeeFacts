# Coffee Facts API

Welcome to Coffee Facts API! This project is for anyone looking to learn about interacting with APIs, creating routes,
or, for those who love coffee, that amazing energizing elixir, to borrow a term from [Boston Dynamic's Spot the Dog with
Nature Documentary personality](https://youtu.be/djzOBZUFzTw?si=7GcjxQoGOI_IjBnP&t=438). Whether you're into coding or
want to help the project grow by contributing to the codebase or high-quality facts and their sources by logging into
the site, you're in the right place!
