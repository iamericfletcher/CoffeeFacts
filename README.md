# Coffee-Facts-API

Welcome to Coffee Facts API! This project is for anyone looking to learn about interacting with APIs, creating routes,
or, for those who love coffee, that amazing energizing elixir, to borrow a term from [Boston Dynamic's Spot the Dog with
Nature Documentary personality](https://youtu.be/djzOBZUFzTw?si=7GcjxQoGOI_IjBnP&t=438). Whether you're into coding or
want to help the project grow by contributing to the codebase or high-quality facts and their sources by logging into
the site, you're in the right place!

This is the frontend repository. The backend repository is located
at [Coffee Facts API Backend](https://github.com/iamericfletcher/CoffeeFactsDBAPI).

## Tech Stack

- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0, express-oauth2-jwt-bearer
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: SQLite3 - currently hosted on DigitalOcean Droplet
- **Deployment**: GitHub and DigitalOcean App Platform
- **Frontend**: Express with EJS templates, Axios to communicate with the backend
- **Process Management**: PM2
- **Rate Limiting**: Express Rate Limit

## Rate Limiting
The API has a rate-limit of 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP.

## Middleware
- `limiter`: Handles rate limiting.
- `isAdmin`: Checks if the logged-in user is an admin.
- `countRoutes`: Counts the number of backend routes hit by the user.

## UserFlow
- User logs in with Auth0.
- User is redirected to the homepage.
- User can view a random coffee fact on the homepage.
- User can view their profile.
- User can add a new coffee fact from their profile.
- User can edit or delete coffee facts they've previously submitted from their profile page.
- User can edit or delete coffee facts they've submitted but not yet reviewed by an admin from their profile page.
- Admin can view admin panel.
- Admin can view all unapproved facts from the admin panel.
- Admin can approve or reject a pending fact from the admin panel.
